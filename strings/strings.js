// when you want to use quotation marks inside a string put a back slash to have the quotes ignored
// if you want to include a backslash just put a backslash before it so 2 backslashes
// \n stands for new line so if you do " Hello \n World it will print it on two lines"
// \t stands for tab so it adds the tab funtion to the text indenting it
console.log("Hello \n World");
console.log("hello \n \t world");

// ` backticks are for using a function inside of a string
console.log(str);

// strings are immudable data types meanign you can access the data types but you cant change them
// like you can with arrays
